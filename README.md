# Find My Peoples!

This mobile first app aims to simplify political door-to-door surveying. 

It is essential for political parties to identify where their supporters live, so that on election day, teams of volunteers can encourage people to go and vote. In a tight election this can make the difference between winning and losing. 

This app lets you enter the details of a street you want to survey, then a property number, then the names of occupants. You can then record their political affiliations.
